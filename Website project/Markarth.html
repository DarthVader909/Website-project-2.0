        <p class="paragraph1">
            Markarth, also known as Markarth Side, is one of the many major cities in Skyrim.
            It is known for its rich silver mines that use <em>convict labour</em>, which are mostly owned by the influential <strong>Silver-Bloods family.</strong>
            The cutthroat intrigue surrounding Markarth's silver producing industry popularized the local saying,
            <em>"Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth...."</em> The city is located in the far west of Skyrim,
            in the mountains of <b>The Reach</b>, west of the Karth River. As a result, the city has a good natural defense,
            even from the skies. Being a long distance from any other major city and with both main roads cutting through mountains,
            valleys and rugged terrain, venturing to and from Markarth is one of the most treacherous trips for travelers.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph1">
            Origins Markarth Seal Markarth was the former city of <strong>Nchuand-Zel</strong>, belonging to the ancient Dwemer (also known as the Dwarves)
            who resided in <b>Morrowind, Skyrim, Hammerfell and High Rock</b> during the Merethic Era and First Era.
            Following the disappearance of the Dwemer from the face of Nirn after they attempted to control the power of the <i>>Numidium</i>,
            Markarth was abandoned until the natives of the Reach known as Reachmen, moved into the city. The rise of <strong>High King Olaf One-Eye</strong>,
            who expanded Skyrim's boundaries when he conquered the Reach, saw that the city be turned over to Nord control.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            Establishment in gratitude for the service of the Tongues in Tamriel's long and complex history,
            <strong>Emperor Tiber Septim</strong> established the Imperial College of the Voice in Markarth,
            which was dedicated to returning the Way of the Voice to the ancient and honorable art of war.
            So it may be that the mighty deeds of the Nord heroes of old will soon be equalled or surpassed on the battlefields of the present day.
            Unlike the other Dwemer cities and strongholds located in <b>Morrowind, Hammerfell,High Rock and Skyrim</b>,
            the city of Markarth was not constructed out of metal, but instead was primarily built out of stone.
            According to Amanda Alleia, a mercenary in Markarth, Dwemer miners had cut out the city from the mountains,
            which probably means that the external part of the city that's outside of the mountains was built by the Dwemer themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            The Forsworn Uprising Markarth The banner of Markarth. In 4E 174, Markarth, and the Reach as a whole,
            were subjected to what is known today as the <mark>"Forsworn Uprising</mark>." While the Empire was beset by the <strong>Third Aldmeri Dominion</strong> in the Great War,
            the native people of the Reach, called the Reachmen, took this opportunity to seize control of the city.
            This was only possible as the <b>Imperial Legionnaires</b> stationed in Markarth were recalled to fight the forces of the Dominion,
            leaving the city highly vulnerable to conquest.
