            Whiterun <i>(Dragon Language: Ahrol-Se-Dovah: "Hill-Of-Dragon")</i> is the capital city of Whiterun Hold, in the center of Skyrim.
            In Whiterun, Nords live in the 'traditional' manner: <q>their lives are simple, harsh, and rooted in ancient ideas</q>.
            Even the city's fortifications—wooden and stone palisade walls and the sheer defensive advantage
            offered by its position on a large bluff that raises the city above the surrounding tundra—are archaic by contemporary standards.
            Due to its central location, Whiterun serves as the commercial heart of Skyrim.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            Whiterun Seal The symbol of Whiterun.
            Whiterun is located on the eastern end of its Hold,
            in the tundra plains that fill the center of Skyrim.
            It was founded by Jeek of the River, who was the captain of <em>Jorrvaskr</em>.
            Upon discovery of the <strong>Skyforge</strong>, he and his men constructed the great <strong>mead hall of Jorrvaskr</strong>,
            which at the time was the sole structure on the bluff. Now, Whiterun is a large city,
            albeit one that retains the feel of a smaller Nord village.
            The central location and easy access make it one of the most successful cities in trade.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            First Era When approaching Whiterun, the towering <strong>fortress of Dragonsreach</strong> dominates the view.,
            Its history can be traced back to the First Era, when King Olaf One-Eye subdued the great dragon Numinex
            in a legendary duel of Thu'um atop Mount Anthor and brought him back to the fledgling town as a captive.
            It was then that the magnificent keep was rebuilt and renamed to serve as a cage for Numinex, whose head still adorns the Great Hall.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            Gjalund was the Jarl of Whiterun sometime in the First Era.
            As Jarl, his holdings included <strong>Whiterun, Granite Hill, Rorikstead, Old H'roldan, Bromjunaar, Korvanjund, Volunruud and Ivarstead.</strong>
