            Windhelm, also known as the City of Kings, is a city located in northeastern Skyrim.
            It serves as the capital of <strong>Eastmarch Hold</strong>. It is also the oldest city in Skyrim,
            possibly the oldest city of man on <strong>Tamriel</strong> that is still standing, dating back to the Merethic Era.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            <mark>During 4E 201, as the Skyrim Civil War rages on, Skyrim becomes a nation divided</mark>,
            and Windhelm becomes the new capital of the Stormcloak Rebellion,
            the main center of the entire <i>Nord revolution against the Empire</i>.
            Windhelm is governed by <strong>Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak</strong>, the leader of the Stormcloaks.
            Ulfric was chosen by the public as the new Jarl of Windhelm after his father, the previous Jarl, died.
            At least three of Skyrim's other eight holds pledged loyalty to Ulfric and his Stormcloak Rebellion
            during this time: <em>the Pale, the Rift and Winterhold,
            along with their Jarls, Skald the Elder, Korir, and Laila Law-Giver</em>.
            Whiterun Hold remains neutral ground as Balgruuf the Greater refuses to take a side in the conflict,
            while the <strong>Reach, Falkreath, and Hjaalmarch</strong>,
            remain loyal to the Empire alongside <strong>Haafingar Hold</strong> and the provincial capital, <strong>Solitude</strong>,
            under High King Torygg's widow, Elisif the Fair.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            Ulfric believes that Skyrim should secede from what he believes is a corrupt and crumbling Empire.
            This stance came about due to the aftermath of the <i>Great War</i> and the introduction of the
            ,<abbr title="White-Gold Concordat">WGC</abbr> by the Aldmeri Dominion,
            though it was not until the Markarth Incident that Ulfric's rebellion truly started.
