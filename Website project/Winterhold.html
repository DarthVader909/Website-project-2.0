            Winterhold is a former major city which is located in northern Skyrim.
            It is the capital city of the hold of the same name.
            Once a great capital rivaling <strong>Solitude</strong> in power and importance,
            <strong>Winterhold</strong> is now little more than a shell of its former self due to the Great Collapse.
            The only surviving fort in the hold is <strong>Fort Kastav</strong> to the south.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            Origins and Establishment Legends claim that the city was made during the First Era,
            when <em>Arch-Mage Shalidor</em> built the city of Winterhold with a <i>whispered spell</i>.
            Whether Winterhold was actually built with magic is unknown, as it could be a hyperbole of <i>Shalidor's power</i>.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            <mark>In 1E 369, High King Borgas of Winterhold was killed during the Wild Hunt</mark>.
            This plummeted Skyrim into the War of Succession, which broke apart the First Nordic Empire.
            <strong>Jarl Hanse</strong>, the ruler of Winterhold, was supposedly the most capable candidate for High King
            at the time and that the Moot's failure to appoint him eventually led to the war.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            <mark>Winterhold Rebellion in 1E 2804, an event called the Winterhold Rebellion took place in protest of the forced conscription</mark>
            which was being imposed on the populace. The following year, the city was sacked.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            Golden Age During the third century of the Third Era, <strong>Baron Ulfe Gersen</strong> ruled over Winterhold.
            He "brought considerable wealth and influence" with <strong>Morihatha Septim</strong> when they married,
            which enabled them both to help <strong>Uriel Septim VI</strong> with his political struggles against the Elder Council.
            Also during the Third Era, it was said that the people of Winterhold favored the use of Axes that were <q>six feet in length</q>.
