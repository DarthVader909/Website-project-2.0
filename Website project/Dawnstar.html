        Dawnstar is <b>one of the major cities in Skyrim.</b>
        <em>Governed by Jarl Skald the Elder,</em> <ins>Dawnstar is the capital of The Pale,</ins> and is known for its rich mines and harbor.
        It also serves as a garrison town along the northern coast of Skyrim.
        Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim; along with <strong>Winterhold and Windhelm,</strong>
        as it resides in perpetual snow and ice.
        <strong>Fort Dunstad</strong> is located to the southeast, near the <i>Hall of the Vigilant</i> and the border with Winterhold.

    <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            It was after the destruction of a fortress in Dawnstar <strong>during 2E 283 that Potentate Versidue Shaie declared martial law,</strong>
            leading to one of the most brutal and bloody periods in the history of Tamriel.
            This also led to the creation of the <mark>Fighters Guild, Mages Guild</mark>, and <mark>Thieves Guild</mark> during the Guilds Act.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            The village was rebuilt at least before the end of the Third Era.
            However, it is noted in the <strong>Pocket Guide</strong> to the Empire,
            <em>Third Edition: Skyrim that Macalla was the Queen of Dawnstar, and had married King Thian of Solitude.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            Around 4E 201, Dawnstar's citizens were suffering from a series of nightmares by the <i>Skull of
            Corruption</i>, Daedric artifact of the <ins>Daedric Prince Vaermina</ins>. <ins>The Last Dragonborn and a former priest of
            Vaermina, a dunmer named Erandur</ins>, <em>went to Nightcaller Temple and ended the city's suffering.</em>
