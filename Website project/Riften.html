            Riften, referred to as <strong>Rifton</strong> in earlier records, is a city situated in the southeastern corner of The Rift,
            at the eastern end of <b>Lake Honrich</b>, with a good portion of the city actually spilling over the water atop large wooden piers.
            It is the southernmost and easternmost of all the cities in Skyrim.
            <strong>Fort Greenwall</strong> is a short distance beyond the guard towers at the northern gate.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            The entire city is bisected by a large canal that used to serve as access for small cargo boats,
            but lately has fallen into disrepair, decay, and stagnation thanks to the lack of trade during the Civil War.
            Despite this, Riften remains a bustling center of commerce; 
            the <strong>Black-Briar Meadery</strong> has a near monopoly on the sale and distribution of a Nord's favorite pastime: drinking.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            The city is located in the <b>beautiful Autumnal Forest region</b> of Skyrim, and that beauty has encroached upon the city,
            in the form of wondrous foliage and generally pleasant, if not sometimes overcast weather. 
            But most of Riften's structures are wooden, and the city gives off an old and run-down feeling,
            which often takes visitors by surprise. Not that this bothers the residents, who see Riften for what it truly isâ€”a bustling,
            energetic city with a strong economy fueled by hard-working fishermen and mead makers.
            Despite the fact that the current Jarl in office is <em>Laila Law-Giver</em>, the residents understand that the city is,
            for all intents and purposes, actually owned and operated by <strong>Maven Black-Briar</strong>, and in order to survive and thrive,
            one needs to adhere to her rules. Maven's hold over the city is so great, that in the event of an Imperial victory,
            Maven takes the position of Jarl after Laila is removed and banished to live in <strong>Windhelm</strong> in the <i>Palace of the Kings</i>
            and remarks that it is only as a title, with her son serving as her steward.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            Despite the city's economic strength, it holds a darker side.
            The home of the notorious <i>Thieves Guild</i> in Skyrim, Riften also sees much corruption in the form of <strong>Maven Black-Briar</strong>,
            especially when dealing with rivals. Many poor residents frequent the less desirable areas and thieves, both Guild and freelance,
            take advantage of the frequent mist, dark alleys, and the Canal, preying on travelers and citizens alike. Such conditions reflect on the city;
            deaths are common and people will often fight in the street over dropped items.
