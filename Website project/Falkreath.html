            Falkreath is <b>one of the major cities located in Skyrim.</b>
            It is the capital of Falkreath Hold.
            The town lies in the southwest of the province of Skyrim,
            near the borders of <mark>Hammerfell and Cyrodiil</mark>. At one period in history,
            Falkreath was part of Cyrodiil. Later, the town became a settlement in Skyrim.
            During the Fourth Era, when the events of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim take place,
            the <em>Jarl of Falkreath is Siddgeir</em>, having succeeded his uncle, Dengeir of Stuhn.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1">It is famous for its large graveyard, in which many Nords are buried.
            The main stronghold that defends Falkreath, <strong>Fort Neugrad,</strong> is located on the opposite side of the hold,
            near the border with the Rift and the settlement of Helgen.
            The name comes from the Falmer Language, who made a great many elven ruins in the area.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            Pre-Alessian era Falkreath Seal The symbol of Falkreath.
            Early Nords, called Men-of-'Kreath, were a tribe mentioned in The Adabal-a that migrated from Atmora to Skyrim,
            as the Nedes moved to the ice island from <strong>Tamriel</strong>.
            While part of the Colovian conglomerate, the Men-of-'Kreath were an independent tribe on their own;
            it is also possible that the Colovians too were a group of separate tribes who later found the kingdoms of Chorrol,
            <b>Skingrad</b>, <b>Kvatch and Anvil</b>, before the unification of Cyrodiil.
            Thus, they were most likely a North Colovian tribe living in the area of modern Falkreath.
            This is likely, as Falkreath has been historically considered a part of Colovia, not Skyrim.
            The Men-of-'Kreath evidently spoke a Colovian dialect unique from the other tribes, believed to contain some Aldmeris words.
            But, many Nedic tribes, especially in <b>Cyrodiil</b> and <b>Hammerfell</b>, were enslaved by the Ayleids.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            Time of <strong>Tiber Septim</strong> During the time of <strong>Tiber Septim and the Underking, Cuhlecain</strong>, the King of Falkreath in West Cyrodiil,
            was in a bad situation. To make any bid at unifying the <em>Colovian Estates</em>, he needed to secure his northern border,
            where the Nords and Reachmen had been fighting for centuries. He allied with Skyrim at the Battle of <em>Old Hrol'dan.</em>
            Leading his forces was <strong>Hjalti Early-Beard</strong>. Hjalti was from the island kingdom of Alcaire,
            in High Rock, and would become <ins>Tiber Septim, the First Emperor of Tamriel.</ins>
