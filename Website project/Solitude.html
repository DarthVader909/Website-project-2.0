            Solitude is the capital city of both Haafingar Hold, and the province of Skyrim.
            Currently ruled by <strong>Jarl Elisif the Fair</strong>, widow of the late High King Torygg,
            it is the <b>headquarters of the Imperial Legion</b> stationed in Skyrim.
            <strong>General Tullius</strong> commands the Imperial army from the <strong>stone-walled Castle Dour</strong> with his second-in-command,
            <strong>Legate Rikke</strong>, while Solitude's Jarl, Elisif, resides in the Blue Palace.
            <b>The Thalmor</b> have an embassy hidden in the nearby mountains.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            <mark>During 4E 201, as the Skyrim Civil War rages on, Skyrim becomes a nation divided</mark>,
            with three of its nine holds, The Pale, Winterhold, and The Rift, allying with <strong>Ulfric Stormcloak</strong>,
            <strong>Jarl of Eastmarch</strong> Hold and Windhelm, and his Stormcloak rebels,
            while The Reach, Falkreath, and Hjaalmarch remain a part of the Empire,
            leaving Whiterun Hold neutral and middle ground between the two sides until the <i>Battle for Whiterun</i> to decide its allegiance,
            and Solitude serves as the center of Imperial power in Skyrim.
            Much of Solitude's coffers and supplies have been diminished and its security is becoming increasingly vulnerable
            with many of its Hold Guards conscripted to serve in the Legion's army,
            leaving very few to patrol the settlements within Haafingar Hold to keep them safe from threats.
            <strong>Jarl Elisif</strong> considers these sacrifices necessary in order to quell the rebellion and defeat Ulfric
            and is resigned in her belief that <strong>General Tullius</strong> will do what is best since they are so dependent on him.
